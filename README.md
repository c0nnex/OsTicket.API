OsTicket.API
===============

A .NET 4.0 Wrapper around the OsTicket Ticket REST API (https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket-1.8/blob/develop/setup/doc/api/tickets.md).

It also supports two extensions to the API for retrieving the list of Priortities and the list of Help Topics provided the two PHP
files in the API Extensions folder are copied into the OsTicket installation.
